## FAQ:

Q. Looks cool, but... what's a retro?
A. 'Retro' is short for retrospective. A retrospective is one of the core Agile ceremonies. It is used by teams to reflect on the events of their past iteration, with the aim of identifying where they can improve and generating action items that will help them make those improvements.

Q. Why the decision to keep RemoteRetro open source?
A. Because the entire software development community stands on the shoulders of giants, and Stride is no exception. We talked it over, and were unanimous in the desire to give back to open source.

Q. My team is entirely colocated. Should we use RemoteRetro?
A. You certainly could, but we don't recommend it, as there's no substitute for face to face communication. Use a whiteboard!

Q. Who can use RemoteRetro?
A. Anyone with a google account of any kind can enter a retrospective!

Q. Who should facilitate retros?
A. Anyone who's comfortable facilitating. That said, it's seen as an anti-pattern for team leads and higher-ups to regularly facilitate a team's retrospectives, as they can use the facilitatorship to unfairly guide

Q. Where can I learn about planned features and updates?
A. Our backlog resides in GitHub issues.

Q. How many people should participate in a retro?
A: Ideally, a retrospective will contain no more than 10 people. Beyond 10, and folks check out because they feel they can go unnoticed.

Q. Is video conferencing in the works?
A. Incorporating video conferencing directly in the application is in the works, but until it goes live, we recommend pairing RemoteRetro with appear.in, a free service for holding video conferences.

Q. How can I submit feedback on my experience?
A. First-time users are presented with a survey at the close of their retro. Additionally, bugs can be filed via GitHub issues.

Q. I do not like RemoteRetro. To whom do I complain?
A. Stride Consulting. And it's cool, we love feedback. Let'r rip!
