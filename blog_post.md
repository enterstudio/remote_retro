# Introducing RemoteRetro Beta!

Stride is proud to announce the open beta of RemoteRetro, a real-time application for conducting retrospectives on distributed teams. The application aims to provide an intuitive, safe, fun experience for users, providing guidance as the retrospective progresses, and automating many common facilitation tasks, including action-item distribution.

The beta is live at remoteretro.org, and the code is open-source and available at https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro.

## FAQ:

Q. Looks cool, but... what's a retro?

A. 'Retro' is short for retrospective. A retrospective is one of the core Agile ceremonies. It is used by teams to reflect on the events of their past iteration, with the aim of identifying where they can improve and generating action items that will help them make those improvements.

Q. Who can use RemoteRetro?
A. Anyone with a google account of any kind can enter a retrospective!

Q. My team is entirely colocated. Should we use RemoteRetro?
A. You certainly _could_, but we don't recommend it, as there's no substitute for face to face communication. Use a whiteboard!

Q. Why the decision to keep RemoteRetro open source?
A. Because the entire software development community stands on the shoulders of giants, and Stride is no exception. We talked it over, and were unanimous in the desire to give back to open source.

Q. Who should facilitate retros?
A. Anyone who's comfortable facilitating. That said, it's seen as an anti-pattern for team leads and higher-ups to regularly facilitate a team's retrospectives, as they can use the facilitatorship to unfairly guide

Q. Where can I learn about planned features and updates?
A. Our backlog resides in GitHub issues, which can be viewed in priority order via the wonderful ZenHub Chrome extension.

Q. How many people should participate in a retro?
A: Ideally, a retrospective will contain no more than 10 people. Beyond 10, and folks check out because they feel they can go unnoticed. If you can, keep the numbers low!

Q. How can I submit feedback on my experience?
A. Users are presented with a survey at the close of their first retro. Additionally, bugs and feature requests can be filed via GitHub issues at https://github.com/stride-nyc/remote_retro/issues/new or via email at tvanderhoop@stridenyc.com.
